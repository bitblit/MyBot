# @bitblit/MyBot

Code for my robot in Typescript

## Installation

`npm install @bitblit/mybot`

## Usage

TBD

## Dependencies

Since this is meant to be a very generic library and therefore I don't want to pull in a bunch of transitive
dependencies, I am keeping myself to very, very few upstream libraries. However, I am making the following exceptions,
because I use these libraries in literally every project I have ever done:

- Moment - because I always need better date handling than what comes with Javascript
- Moment-Timezone - because I always need timezone specific handling of date

# Testing

Ha! No, seriously - I am actually improving on this in Node, slowly (2018-03-23)

To run the tests that ARE in here,

`npm test`

# Contributing

Pull requests are welcome, although I'm not sure why you'd be interested!
